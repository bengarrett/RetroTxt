Linkify works with all kinds of links. Here are some examples:

- URLs with protocols: https://github.com
- URLs without protocols: www.twitter.com
- Emoji domains like 👻💥.ws
- IP Addresses such as 127.0.0.1
- Email addresses (hello@example.com)
- "At"-Mentions like @tc39 or @rust-lang
- Hashtags #PhotoOfTheDay or #일상

The site example.com can be found at https://example.com.

Let's try a list of filenames:

.bash_history .bash_profile .bashrc
.DS_Store .zshrc .npm git go Downloads .local
.Trash private.key public.key
program.com program.exe program.bat
