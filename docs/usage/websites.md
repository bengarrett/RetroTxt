For the fans of ANSI and ASCII art, there are several websites that RetroTxt monitors in the background. [These are optional](secure.md/#remove-suggestions).

The only permanent domain is [retrotxt.com](https://retrotxt.com/e), which is used as a fallback to confirm the Extension installation works.  This domain also hosts the Sample artworks you can access by typing `txt samples` in the address bar.
