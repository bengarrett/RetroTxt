## 5.3

### January 2024

- New [Intel One Mono fonts](https://github.com/intel/intel-one-mono).
- Removed the *column wrap* toggle from the information header of a RetroTxt browser tab.
  The feature was confusing with the *page wrap* toggle, and would not work correctly with the _80 column wrap_ ANSI option in the RetroTxt Options.
- Fixed a major issue in Chrome 118+, with text files breaking due to the [Sanitizer API deprecation](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/sanitizer-api-deprecation). As a stopgap, the [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) library is used to sanitise the text files.
- The RetroTxt options tab changes the document title.
- Clicking the links or buttons in the toolbar popup will only ever open one RetroTxt options tab.
- Fixed Monitor downloads launching twin tabs of the same file.
- Minor tweak to the Getting Started dialog text.
- Removed `version_name` from the manifest as it hid useful version information.
- Fixed `C:/` drive being referenced on non-Windows operating systems.
- Fixed "RetroTxt has run into a problem" displaying the wrong keyboard keys on macOS.
- Fixed `package.json` `version` number not matching the manifest.

## 5.2

### June 2023

- New Display Hyperlinks option to convert plain text URLs, emails and IP addresses into hyperlinks.
- New [Cascadia Mono and Code fonts](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/), that support ligatures and Powerline symbols.
- Toolbar popup contains icons with links to the fonts, display, settings options and a link to the RetroTxt Extension Details tab.
- Update Spleen fonts to v2.0 and include the use of size 32x64 variation.
- Fixed Page wrap behaviour not replicating on new tabs.
- Hyperlinked the Allow access to file URLs is off notice in the popup.

## 5.1

### April 2023

- Change the behavior of the toolbar button to display useful usability information.
  The previous, unreliable per-tab on/off toggle function would sometimes have Chrome disconnect the button from the tab, breaking the functionality.
- The home and office computer fonts use a local, monospaced font as the fallback. Previously, the browser would show out-of-range characters in a variable-width font, making blocks and line characters look unnecessarily messy.
- Update the Information header to reorder the information displayed and mention the shortcut keys to view the original text.
- Update and fix broken links to external resources and prioritized HTTPS over HTTP schemes.
- Rearrange the Settings and Feature pane to emphasize the _add_ domain input.
- Fix a bug that gave RetroTxt access to the Suggested domains after removing them.

## 5.0

### [Migration to Manifest v3](/src/mv3) ~ September 2022

!!! warning
    Unfortunately, some Options settings may be lost in this upgrade when updating from RetroTxt versions 4.

!!! info
    Currently this v5.0 upgrade is not available to Firefox.

### Highlights

- Options interface should be more responsive with less visual jank.
- RetroTxt features and functions are more reliable.
- Changing Options should apply to all open tabs, including focused and unfocused tabs.
<hr>
- Manifest v3 has much better error handling and there should be less uncaptured errors.
- Unfocused tabs can run RetroTxt in the background.
- Browser tab displays the SAUCE title and author when available.
- Artworks linked in the Samples tab display the title and author on the browser tab.
- Smear block characters are applied to BBS texts.
- Monitor downloads works better with 16colo.rs and defacto2.net by ignoring their incorrect `Content-Type` headers.
- New Toolbar icon setting to select dark or light mode button.
- Updated the Welcome, new install text to be a Getting started with RetroTxt brief.
- Information header encoding can be clicked to change the encoding.
<hr>
- Fixed font size adjustment for 2x and 3x values. Text now centre aligns and stopped unexpected text wrapping.
- Fixed Options reloading the page when a new tab was selected.
- Tweaked the Information header CSS to use very slight rounded corners.
- Documentation tab in Options shares the same layout and formatting as the other menus.
- Settings - Run RetroTxt on files hosted on these domains<br>
  The on/off toggle has been removed for code simplification.<br>
  Created a button to remove and restore website suggestions.<br>
  Hostname input form responds to <kbd>Enter â†µ</kbd> key presses.
- Settings - Monitor downloads, toggles the optional `download` and `downloads.open` permissions.
- Mentions of the file scheme `file:///`, will under Windows display as `file:///C:/`
- Transcode context menu is disabled by default except for textfile tabs.
- Replaced the `scripts/eventpage.js` background page with modular service workers.
- Replaced and split the `scripts/functions.js` shared functions page with `scripts/helpers.js` for content-scripts and `scripts/sw/helpers.js` for service workers.
- Replaced simple one-time message requests with long-lived connections where needed.<br>
  This should fix some strange behaviour and failures that occurred in previous versions.
- Removed the use of `Window.localStorage` and `Window.sessionStorage` which held Options settings and replaced it with `chrome.storage.local`.<br>
  This was needed as the `Window` interface is not accessible by service workers which are required by Manifest v3.
- Dropped the permissions requirement for `tabs`.
- Dropped the Transcode text context menu.
<hr>
- Using pnpm as the dependencies manager.
- The use of Manifest v3 with service workers is incompatible with Firefox.
- Removed the Firefox specific build tools.

## 4.2

### October 2021

## 3.0

### Highlights

- User interface improvements and bug fixes.
- Much improved legacy code page detection and support.
- New progressive permissions for enhanced security.
- New redesign of the Options menu.
- New ASCII text theme for your own custom background/foreground colours.

### November 2018

- Rewrote the Code Page 437 normaliser, the character conversions are more accurate.
- RetroTxt gracefully recovers after the unintentional deletion of storage items.
- RetroTxt out of the box is locked down with gradual permission privileges requests when features are enabled.
  Previously RetroTxt always had access to downloads, http/ftp tabs, etc. regardless of whether they were needed or not. However, these are moving to `optional_permissions` which grant access on an associated Option.
- Broad `http://*/` and `https://*/` read permissions are gone in favour of domain-specific access such as `https://retrotxt.com/*` and `http://retrotxt.com/*`.
  RetroTxt never read more than the first two characters of any HTML tab that is active, but it was not a good look for new users
  seeing _Read and change all your data on the websites that you visit_ in the add-ons menu.
- Redesigned the Options menu to better match the new user interface introduced in Chrome v69. This required the disabling of the
  `chrome_style` manifest UI option which hasn't been updated since early 2016.
- Added a [privacy policy](https://github.com/bengarrett/RetroTxt/wiki/privacy) with API permission requirements.
- Added Option to use a customised colour set for the text foreground and background.
- Added IBM's 2017 [Plex Mono font](https://www.ibm.com/plex/).
- Added Macintosh-Roman, ISO8859-10 code page support.
- Mouse hovering on the information header font name reveals more descriptive font information.
- Added Option to toggle blinking text and cursor animations.
- Added a `textmod.es/crew` link to SAUCE header data for some ANSI groups when their group data are matches in the SAUCE metadata.
- Added new icons for Firefox dark themes.
- Firefox uses SVG icons.
- _Center align text_ now previews in the sample text.
- RetroTxt browser toolbar button now behaves differently to avoid occasional false positives. Instead of disabling itself when an invalid page is detected, the button now shows a âœ” checkmark whenever a compatible tab is active. The compatibility results vary based on the Extension permissions grants.
- Fixed PCBoard & Wildcat BBS colour inaccuracies in the CSS.
- Remapped CGA palettes so black is less frequent.
- Text that lack line breaks now wrap to the browser tab.
- CSS variables are more frequently in use.
- Added install type detection that enables a verbose mode when the type is `development`.
- Source code uses [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for opinionated formatting.
- Refactored most of the JS to use [ES5 Class expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) so the source code easier to follow.
  It is still a TODO item for `parse_ansi.js`.
- Using separate manifest.json and options.html for Firefox and Chrome. The Chrome Extension API hasn't been updated since early 2016 and is now the legacy implementation.
- Saves the Options last active tab.
- Expanded the number of unit tests to cover more of the application.
- Fixed incorrect keyboard keys displayed on alerts with macOS.
- Fixed Options icons links with underlined artefacts in Chrome.
- Fixed Options now gracefully handle the removal of localStorage items.
- Fixed broken Options links when in `development` install type.

### Known issues

- Currently, you cannot make additions to the _Apply RetroTxt to text files hosted on these websites_ list. The problem is due to
  new permissions API implementation that requires all sites to be listed in the `manifest.json`.
- On Firefox 63 the Options fonts menu sprawls across the screen, this is fixed in version 64.
- On Firefox Linux the Zeus II logo for the welcome screen is broken.
- For some distributions with Firefox on Linux the select menus have extra large, unreadable fonts.

- Fixed unsupported ECMA-48 controls reported as unknown.
- Fixed blinking cursor not positioning correctly on small ANSI documents.
- Fixed _text render_ methods not applied to ANSI documents.
- Fixed white background themes that were not showing ECMA-48 bold text due to foreground and backgrounds colours being the same.

- Detects and converts legacy BBS colour codes for [PCBoard and Wildcat!](http://wiki.synchro.net/custom:colors#pcboard_wildcat_format).
- **_Apply RetroTxt to any text files hosted on these websites_** will only run on a user supplied whitelist of website domains. This will stop it from conflicting with secure login sessions used by some websites.

- Fixed Options not supporting UK locales.
- Fixed first time run bugs that required RetroTxt to reload for it to work correctly.
- Fixed RetroTxt trying to run on about: URIs.
- RetroTxt should be slightly less resource intensive as previously there were some event filters that Firefox was ignoring.

## 1.25

### 2 July 2016

- **_Automatic detect & run RetroTxt on text files feature_** **is now more reliable and intuitive**. Its (experimental) tag has been dropped and can now be considered stable.
- _Automatic detect & run RetroTxt..._ also has a hardcoded blacklist of domains to ignore which previously this feature conflicted with.
- Added [QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) testing. A _Tests_ link to the results page will show up with Chrome in Options when using a _development_ install.

## 1.2

### 22 June 2016

- **Now works in Firefox** but requires at least Firefox (Gecko) 48.
- Tested in Opera (Blink) and works great.

#### Differences between using Firefox and Chrome

- Chrome uses event pages while Firefox uses the less desirable persistent background pages. Event pages only load when needed so in theory they should be less resource intensive.
- Firefox and the Gecko engine renders multiple block characters better than the Blink engine used in Chrome. The Blink engine adds light but distracting vertical lines.
- Firefox's Options UI does not support the unified `chrome_style`.
- The toolbar button in Firefox does not support right-click context menus.
- Context menus in Firefox are not filtered by URL types as it doesn't support the `documentUrlPatterns` property.
- When loading RetroTxt both Chrome and Firefox will throw warnings about unrecognised items in the manifest.

## 1.1
