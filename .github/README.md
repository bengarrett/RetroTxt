# RetroTxt

### for manifest version 2

> Welcome to the archived, legacy branch of RetroTxt that relies on the Manifest version 2 API. [The Chrome team discontinued its availability](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/) in Chrome v109 at the start of 2023, while Firefox maintains support for the API.

> Users of Firefox v69+ can use this source, as can Chrome v72 through to v109 and compatible browsers.

## Install

### [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/retrotxt/gkjkgilckngllkopkogcaiojfajanahn) · [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/retrotxt) · [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/hmgfnpgcofcpkgkadekmjdicaaeopkog) · [Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/retrotxt/gkjkgilckngllkopkogcaiojfajanahn)

### [Or use the source code](https://docs.retrotxt.com/source_code).

### Requirements

**Chrome, Chromium 72**, or **Firefox 69** or newer browsers.

## Post-installation

You can test the RetroTxt install by clicking on one of the many sample artworks found in the <em>Samples</em> tab from RetroTxt options or typing `rt samples` in the browser address bar.

## Configuration

Out of the box, some useful features of RetroTxt are off as most browsers require you to grant permission before RetroTxt can [access the specific browser data](https://docs.retrotxt.com/privacy) it needs. These are in the <em>Settings</em> tab from RetroTxt options or typing `rt settings` in the browser address bar.

## Run RetroTxt

Once configured, RetroTxt will run on any text or ANSI art file observed in a permitted browser tab and mark the toolbar icon with a check.

Elsewhere there are thousands of text files hosted at [textfiles.com](http://textfiles.com/directory.html) or the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog) plain-text books.
Turn on the <em>Use RetroTxt as a local text file viewer</em> setting.
Then download one of the fantastic text art packs found at [16 colors](https://16colo.rs) and use the `file:///` protocol to browse and view the text art files saved to your computer.

### Permissions

Chrome, Brave, and Edge require the **Allow access to file URLs** Extension setting enabled if you wish to use RetroTxt with text files stored on your computer.

## Privacy

RetroTxt does not collect or transmit any data created by your web browser.

All data generated by the Extension is only ever stored locally on your computer by using the browser local or session storage APIs.
